## How to launch

The only thing that needs to be checked is the port which will be used for dotnet core application. Ideally it should be localhost:5001 (or some adjustments will be needed to the Frond-end code.

After checking the port, Dotnet core server can be launched with **`dotnet run`** command, angular application can be launched with **`ng serve`**.

## How it works

**Products** page:

As you can see, **filtering** works too.

After clicking on a product a user is redirected on a **product page**.

**Cart page.**

Sadly, haven't managed to do all the functionality in time. So it now only shows prerendered data.
